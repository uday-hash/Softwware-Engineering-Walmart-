After much deliberation amongst your team, you have been trusted to design part of a new data processing pipeline. You will be responsible for coming up with the architecture for a dynamically reconfigurable data processor. The processor will have several different modes, each of which treats incoming data in a different way. Some modes will pass the result along to a database, and others will additionally validate the data against the database. To further complicate matters, there are several databases in play, and the processor needs the ability to toggle between them on the fly. The system needs to be extendable - your team has every intention of adding additional modes and databases in the future - so take extra care to ensure the system isnâ€™t rigid. Adhere to good design principles, use design patterns where they make sense, and remember your SOLID principles. Your project lead will use this to assess your ability to design clean code, so be sure to show off what you know.
